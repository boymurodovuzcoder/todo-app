# Todo App

made with love ❤️

---

#### I have recently finished [Material UI course](https://www.udemy.com/course/implement-high-fidelity-designs-with-material-ui-and-reactjs/) on Udemy. To put my knowledge into practice I decided to develop Todo Application. I have not integrated App with backend except for authentication via Firebase. It means that whenever website is closed, all to-do-related data is lost

#### I would be so happy, if you can contribute to this project.

### How it looks like when you go through the app
